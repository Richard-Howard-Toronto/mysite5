          <h3 class="Strategy">Strategy that Works</h3>
            <p>
              Designing a long term strategy is complex and fundamental to business success.  We work with the management of the company to build a blueprint for the next 3-5 years.
            </p>
            <p>
              Recent contracts have results in new strategies such as doubling the number of $1.0 million+ financial advisors over five years, to a full due diligence and contract negotiation and advise in the aquisition of a minority interest of a private firm so as to expand into a second country.
            </p>
            <p>
              Every strategy has a complete end-to-end plan and execution framework. This includes resource planning, project management, and communications plans.

            Data Analytics
          </h3>
            <p>Data analysis is fundamental to many of the strategic decisions.  We use the latest ideas in data analysis to bring insights to senior management and come up with plans to achieve specific benchmarks and goals. Using modern databases and tools often requires adjustments throughout the firm's end to end processes, including training, quality assurance, database management, programming, human resources, and revising customer contracts and service level agreements so they contain the appropriate terms and conditions to protect the firm.
            </p>
            <p>Many clients have a strong intuitive feel that a process or procedure is not working properly; we use data to help clients understand the root cause of the problem.  For example, we used statistical analysis of GPS data on distance travelled to calculate tolerance thresholds on the accuracy of the data, mileage billing, and the terms of the contract that would be acceptable to clients.

          <h3 class="Strategy">Financial Modelling</h3>
            <p>Many projects involve building sophisticated financial models that give tools for evaluating the impact of different decisions.  For example, a recent contract included building a lease finance model that calculated the change in interest rate risk (debt service, debt to equity, cashflow covered) for a change in market interest rates and different capex rates.  This reframed the dicussion at about senior management from a strategy of "double digit growth" to a new strategy of "growth subject to approved risk ratios and target return on equity".  By reframing the discussion and providing tools to do so, the client changed the strategy, including national expansion plans.
            </p>
            <p>A brokerage firm wanted to change its compensation policies for advisors.  It knew the overall impact on changing compensation bands, but did not have a tool to estimate secondary effects, such as changing ticket sizes by advisors, changing client asset mix levels, or changes in asset types.  A model was developed based on these factors and the result was a new policy that greatly reduced the finanical risk to the firm of making policy changes and at the same time demonstrated to the head office that the policy changes were highly controlled and well planned.</p>

          <h3 class="Strategy">Project Management</h3>
            <p>Many projects require time and workloads which are beyond the existing resources of the management and the firm.  Edgewater can design, structure, lead inititives, pushing projects forward quickly and efficiently.
            </p>
            <p>Edgewater has worked on projects in many countries including Canada, Mexico, Peru, England, Switzerland, Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Panama, Brazil, the Caribbean and Uruguay.
