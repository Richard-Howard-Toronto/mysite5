					<h3 class="title">Tools</h3>
					<p class="description">Many projects in finance, wealth management and manufacturing now require knowledge of how the I.T. departments interact with operations, finance, logistics and HR.  Below are examples of four projects that used databased and data analytics to give advice and counsel on the best business decision to make.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><h4>Understand data: </h4>GPS data stored in Amazon Web Services on distance traveled by a client's trucks was used to link to an internal billing program.  I sampled roughly 2 million data elements and built a statistical model to predict mean, standard deviation and expected drift of the readings over time.  Based on this information, the billing algorithm used to charge the client was adjusted to reduce potential for billing errors, eliminating a large  source of billing problems with clients.</li>
						<li><h4>Measuring the value of a systems upgrade project that cost $5 million in one year:  </h4>A client's IT department had written code to meet new regulatory brokerage requirements but with virtually no documentation or user cases to guide the project.  Spending was budgeted at $2 million and after one year the cost was estimated to be another $5 million.  Working with the IT department I did a analysis of which program modules were adding value to the project. The result was that we terminated about $2 million in future spending.</li>
						<li><h4>Does faster growth creates too much risk?  </h4>Maximum Debt to Leverage for loan program - A client needed to know what the debt-equity ratios of his company would be over the next 20 years based on current borrowing patterns to fund growth. I built a model that allowed the client to make assumptions about interest rate curves and linked that model to a corporate strategy that emphasized ROE over revenue growth, showing that incremental revenue growth above certain levels created unacceptably high financial risk and lower than acceptable risk-adjusted ROE to shareholders.</li>
						<li><h4>Is a sales person good or just lucky that year?  </h4>That was the question one client wanted to know: what should the bonus model be to reward a financial advisor that signs up new clients over 12 months?  Using historical data I built a simple binomial distribution model. The results showed a historically high variance around client acquisition.  The client was told that any on given year an "average" advisor might sign up 0.5x to 2x the expected average, about 66% of the time.  The result was that the bonus program was refocused to reward advisors for three-year average asset growth, and less on one-year client growth.</li>
